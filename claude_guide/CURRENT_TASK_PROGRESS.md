# Current Task Progress - Snowflake Self-Contained Tests

## Task: Update all Snowflake tests to use self-contained pattern

### Progress Summary
- **Completed**: 6 out of 29 tests
- **Current Pattern**: Working successfully with proper semicolons and formatting

### Next Steps When Resuming:
1. Continue with warehouse tests - createWarehouse had timeout issues
2. Then proceed alphabetically through remaining tests
3. Test each one individually after updating

### Key Reminders:
- Always include semicolons between SQL statements
- No indentation in CREATE TABLE columns
- Test individually: `mvn test -Dtest=ChangeObjectTests -DchangeObjects=TEST_NAME -DdbName=snowflake`
- If SQL comparison fails but execution works, document it and move on

### Files to Update for Each Test:
1. `/Users/kevinchappell/Documents/GitHub/liquibase-test-harness/src/main/resources/liquibase/harness/change/changelogs/snowflake/TEST_NAME.xml`
2. `/Users/kevinchappell/Documents/GitHub/liquibase-test-harness/src/main/resources/liquibase/harness/change/expectedSql/snowflake/TEST_NAME.sql`

### Pattern is Proven to Work
The self-contained pattern has been successfully applied and tested on 4 tests. Continue applying the same pattern to all remaining tests.
