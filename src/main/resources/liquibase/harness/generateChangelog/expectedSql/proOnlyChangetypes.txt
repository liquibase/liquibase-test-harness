# Pro-only changetypes — generateChangelog tests
# Applied to ALL databases when running in community (non-Pro) mode.
# These change types require Liquibase Pro/Commercial to create the schema objects
# that generateChangelog would then inspect. Without Pro, the update step fails,
# so the generateChangelog comparison has nothing meaningful to test.
